##MiniTrello

### How to run the project
* Make sure Node and npm is installed on the server.
* Check if Node is already installed or not by running `node -v`.
* Check if npm is installed or not by running `npm -v`.
* Once node and npm is installed clone the git repository or download the zip file and extract it.
* [Here](https://github.com/neelesh33/miniTrello) is the link of Github Repository.

* Now `cd` to project folder and run `npm install`. This will download the dependencies required to run the project.
* Once all the dependencies are downloaded. Run `node bin/www` command to start the server. It should print the message that server has started successfully.
* Now open **localhost:3000** in the browser.

* **Note:** I tested this in ***Ubuntu 14.04***.
